# Blogger-application #

---
A very simple android demo application which uses the Google Blogger API v3 to allow a user to connect to his/her blogger account and do simple postings and viewing of his/her blog.

## Features
Allows user to post a blog 
Allows user to view the posts

**Note:**  
Take note that if the user exits the application while editing a post, there's no guarantee that the post will still be there when user goes back into the app. So it would be better to post it in one shot (Until saving in draft feature is added).

##Roadmap
* Updating of posts
* Saving of posts into drafts
* Allowing the adding of images and links into the posts
